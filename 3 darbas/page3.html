SCP-048 has long been considered the "cursed SCP number" by SCP staff: any items given this designation tend to be 
destroyed, decommissioned, stolen, or otherwise lost to the Foundation, usually through no fault of any individual person. 
In addition, personnel assigned to SCP-048 in its various incarnations have had a 50% higher rate of turnover due to 
death, dismemberment, and disciplinary action.

That's why it has no object class, because if it did, it would be a physical or some kind of memetic (or anti-memetic) object. But it isn't.
