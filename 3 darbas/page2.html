SCP-001 is NOT a single SCP. It is a collection of SCP-001 proposals, because of the symbolism and importance of being the "number one" SCP, 
the Wiki administrators opened it up to proposals, and there were a number of articles written as proposed SCP-001 files.

There are MANY SCP-001 proposals.

I would personaly recommend you read through all of them as almost all of them are quite interesting.

Here's a link to the SCP-001 proposals page:
