SCP-4830 is to be monitored for transmission from the noosphere1 into the infosphere2.

In the case  noosphere-infosphere transmission or situations requiring neutralizing 
SCP-4830 at any cost, Scranton Guillotines3 are to be deployed around all Foundation sites and areas (save Area-13) until SCP-4830 is neutralized.
            
All Foundation  
displaying signs of SCP-4830 exposure are to undergo Class-Z mnestic regimen,    quarantined within a Scranton Guillotine, 
and have their memory dumped    compared to     earliest memory dump on file. 
Any deviation of over 10% in long-term memory is to      a       breach, and the infected employee reassigned to Area-13.
